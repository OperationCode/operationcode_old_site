I’d never really considered the Tech Industry to be for me as a Latina, veteran, mother of two. I was 35 years old and changing careers, quitting my job and having no income was not really an option, my husband was in the middle of a sales internship with very limited pay so for me to really do this there had to be a different kind of opportunity.

Determined to work hard to [find my place in tech](https://medium.com/@andreagriffiths11/online-friends-are-real-friends-516d599dfdd1) I began looking for opportunities, at the time I didn’t know that, far from my home in Orlando an innovative program was being thoughtfully crafted. Geared to help an adult like myself with bills, responsibilities and a diverse background have a real opportunity to apply a lifetime of lessons and learn the skills necessary to enter the Tech industry.

I first learned about [GitHub](https://medium.com/@github) when signing up for Free Code Camp, later when [David Molina](https://medium.com/@davidcmolina) from [Operation Code](https://medium.com/@operation_code) mentioned there was an opportunity that could possibly work for me, he did not say for what company, he wanted to talk to me and take a look at my resume first. After deciding that I could actually do this he shared the link to a job posting. The words “If you don’t know this field, don’t worry we will teach you” were etched in my brain, this was it! The job was to be a Community Manager Apprentice for Atom at GitHub.

Atom is open source at it’s best, and coincidentally the only developer text editor I have ever used. I eagerly applied thinking there would probably be thousands of applicants and I would be lucky to get an email saying “thanks but no thanks”. Instead, I had a call from GitHub’s lead recruiter followed by a technical exercise and video interviews. The interview process gave me a hint as to what a special place GitHub is and man I really, really wanted to be a part of it. After several weeks, I’d figure they’d selected someone else, and then one day I had the call, I was both elated and terrified…am I to old for this? (I had a huge misconception that the tech industry was this only for ivy league, white, 20 year olds) how was I going to move my family to San Francisco? what about my job? what about my boys insurance? would my husband think I’m crazy?

Lucky for me I had my husbands full support (in more ways that one, as I literally sold his car to be able to afford a bigger place). So we packed one car and he hit the road with our dog Charlie. I flew in with the boys a week later to join him. The entire time while packing my house, I kept thinking what if you don’t belong, what if you are too old… I’m happy to say by the end my first day at GitHub I realized that age, race nor gender have anything to do with it, I was now a part of something special.

I feel privileged to be in the presence of so many brilliant people and absolutely excited for the future. GitHub is like no other company, open source can truly and honestly change the world. [Make the world a better place](https://github.com/showcases/social-impact). I get to be a part of this purpose. I am looking forward to this experience, to learning the ropes of community management and contributing as I grow. This will be life changing for me and my family, and I am proud to be a GitHubber.
